# JavaScript Learning Lab

A comprehensive collection of JavaScript exercises, examples, and interactive applications demonstrating core concepts and modern JavaScript features.

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains hands-on JavaScript learning materials covering:
- **Fundamentals**: Variables, types, scope, and basic operations
- **Functions**: Closures, async/await, promises, and function scope
- **Arrays & Objects**: Manipulation, methods, and data structures
- **Advanced Topics**: Arrow functions, type coercion, error handling
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, getters, setters
- **Interactive Applications**: Hangman game, Notes app, Todo app

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- A local web server (for running HTML applications)

### Running the Applications

For the interactive applications (hangman, notes-app, todo-app), you'll need to serve the files through a local web server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (with http-server)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and navigate to the desired application.

### Running Individual Scripts

Most JavaScript files can be run directly with Node.js:

```bash
node basics/hello-world.js
node functions/closures.js
```

## 📖 Learning Path

1. Start with `basics/` to understand core concepts
2. Move to `functions/` for function fundamentals
3. Explore `arrays/` and `objects/` for data manipulation
4. Study `advanced/` topics for deeper understanding
5. Review `oop/` for object-oriented patterns
6. Build with the interactive applications

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript features and syntax
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for applications
- **CSS3**: Styling for interactive applications
- **Local Storage**: Browser-based data persistence

## 📝 Notes

- All code examples are self-contained and can be run independently
- Applications use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Code includes both learning exercises and practical implementations
